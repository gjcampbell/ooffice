This virtual tree is intended for business applications where the on-call support can fix most problems by asking "did you try it in chrome?" Developing for one browser is very cost effective.

## Other Options

Here are some other virtual tree implementations for angular.

## Contribute

If you find a bug, the best thing is to fix it, and submit a pull request. The second best thing is to open an issue and provide a lot of details and rage emojis and venting. The worst best thing is to not do anything. Any contribution is appreciated :)

Run `npm run ng serve of-demo`

Open [localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) in chrome
